# Color-Generator

A simple React app that takes as user input a specific color code and then displays 10 shades of it from lightest to darkest. The user can also copy the code for one of the shades of the color he/she inputed, at which time a notice of 'copied to clipboard' will display within that shade's square and then dissapear after 3 seconds.

The app is based on the eponimous project that appears in the tutorial [Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo) by freeCodeCamp.org.
